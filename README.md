This paper discusses energy transitions in developing economies.
Major global energy transitions from wood to coal to oil have take 50 to 60 years.
Natural gas is currently ascendant, surpassing coal in 2015 in the United States and currently is used at twice the rate as renewables.
Developing economies lag the United States in the transition away from coal and oil, even wood in the case of rural communities.
The theory of technology leapfrogging suggests that countries can accelerate their development by skipping more expensive, less efficient technologies.
Developing coutries move directly to advanced technologies.
I explore whether there is evidence of technology leapfrogging in several developing countries: India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Vietnam.
I also explore the economic policies these countries have put in place
to balance the benefits of rapid economic growth with clean energy goals,
to promote the development of indigenous industries while encouraging income and investment and technology transfers,
and to navigate the influence of regional and global energy and environmental regimes.
